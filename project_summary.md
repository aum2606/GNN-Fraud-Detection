# GNN Fraud Detection Project Summary

## Project Overview

This project implements a fraud detection system for blockchain networks, focusing on identifying illicit transactions in the Elliptic Bitcoin dataset. We have successfully implemented Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for this task, specifically Graph Attention Networks (GAT) and Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGN).

## Completed Components

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Implemented a preprocessing script (`src/data/preprocess.py`) that loads, analyzes, and preprocesses the Elliptic Bitcoin dataset
   - Created temporal train/validation/test splits based on time steps
   - Normalized features and removed self-loops
   - Generated dataset statistics and visualizations

2. **Model Implementation**
   - Implemented Graph Attention Network (GAT) in `src/models/gat.py`
   - Implemented Temporal Graph Neural Network (TGN) in `src/models/tgn.py`
   - Resolved compatibility issues with PyTorch Geometric
   - Created a modular architecture for easy experimentation

3. **Training and Evaluation**
   - Implemented a comprehensive training script (`src/train.py`) with early stopping and model checkpointing
   - Created an evaluation script (`src/evaluate.py`) that generates performance metrics and visualizations
   - Implemented a main script (`src/main.py`) to run the entire pipeline
   - Added model comparison functionality (`compare_gnn_models.py`)

4. **Visualization and Analysis**
   - Generated graph visualizations of the transaction network
   - Created visualization tools for model performance (ROC curves, PR curves, confusion matrices)
   - Implemented transaction-specific analysis for inference
   - Generated comprehensive reports on model performance

## Key Findings

1. **Dataset Characteristics**
   - The dataset contains 203,769 nodes (transactions) and 234,355 edges (connections)
   - Significant class imbalance: only 2.23% of transactions are illicit
   - 77.15% of transactions have unknown labels

2. **Model Performance Comparison**
   - **Temporal Graph Neural Network (TGN)**:
     - Accuracy: 83.86%, Precision: 37.64%, Recall: 99.52%, F1 Score: 54.62%
     - AUC-ROC: 98.82%, AUC-PR: 90.59%
   
   - **Graph Attention Network (GAT)**:
     - Accuracy: 76.68%, Precision: 29.46%, Recall: 99.63%, F1 Score: 45.48%
     - AUC-ROC: 98.49%, AUC-PR: 89.39%
   
   - **TGN outperforms GAT** across most metrics, demonstrating the value of incorporating temporal information in fraud detection.
   - Both models achieve excellent recall (>99.5%), indicating they successfully identify almost all fraudulent transactions.

3. **Graph Visualization Insights**
   - Visualized the full transaction graph, fraudulent subgraph, and prediction-based visualizations
   - Created transaction-specific analysis visualizations that show the local neighborhood of transactions
   - Demonstrated how the models use graph structure to make predictions

## Next Steps

1. **Model Improvements**
   - Fine-tune hyperparameters to improve precision while maintaining high recall
   - Implement ensemble methods combining multiple GNN architectures
   - Explore self-supervised learning approaches for better feature representations

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Develop additional features based on graph structure
   - Create more sophisticated temporal features to capture evolving patterns
   - Analyze and select the most discriminative features

3. **Deployment Considerations**
   - Create an API for real-time fraud detection
   - Implement a monitoring system to track model performance
   - Develop a feedback loop for incorporating new labeled data
